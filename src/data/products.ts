    description:
      'The tilt & turn windows are one of the most versatile windows available in the market. These windows are multifunctional. They tilt open at the top for controlled ventilation (when required) and swing open like a door for greater ventilation. The tilting option prevents rain from entering but allows the room to remain well aired. Both these operations are controlled by the simple turn of a handle. Apart from this, they are available in aluminum frames to enhance durability and aesthetic features. Install them in spaces that require additional ventilation and comfort.',
